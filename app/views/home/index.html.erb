Having just celebrated the first anniversary of its landmark, groundbreaking Open Data Law, DataGotham is once again setting the pace in urban innovation by mandating that all city agencies release their data to the public.  This is a veritable treasure trove for the open source community. Joel will give an overview of the Cityâ€™s Open Data Initiative, including a short history of how the Open Data Law came about, how it powers NYCBigApps, and how the data is being used for all kinds of innovations - by the City, by Civic Hackers and the private sector to improve the lives of New Yorkers and to create new businesses. He will also preview the Linked Data Commons that Ontodia is building and launching summer of 2013.</p>
